## Biography

I was born and raised in Linz, Austria and graduated from _HLW f√ºr Kommunikations- und Mediendesign_, which included an education in Econimics as well as in communication and media design. After school I moved to Vienna to study _Software & Information Engineering_ at the Vienna University of Technology. In July 2011 I received my bachelors degree and started my Masters in _Software Engineering & Internet Computing_. In March 2012 I also began working on a supplement curriculum in _Innovation_, which I received in March 2014. I finsished my Masters studies in January 2018 by writing my thesis on _Machine Learning Approach for Web Ranking Identification based on Visual Features_.

When I was a child I made magazines with friends and sold them to family members. When the Internet became a thing I moved my creative endeavors into the digital space. I tought myself the required design and programming skills and started making websites about stuff I like. After some years of freelancing while in school I started my first serious job in 2008 at 2beFOUND in Vienna to build web sites and applications. In April 2016 I joined the startup Kiweno in Vienna as a full time Frontend Developer. From January 2017 to Mai 2018 I was working full time at Swell as Frontend &amp; Mobile App Developer. In August 2018 I joined [mySugr](https://mysugr.com) as Senior Frontend Developer. Since January 2020 I am the Head of Web Development at mySugr.

I never stopped creating websites and applications about stuff I am passionate about. For multiple years I ran a weblog called [Web Adventures](http://webadventures.at) and over the years I created a number of fun side-[projects](/projects).
