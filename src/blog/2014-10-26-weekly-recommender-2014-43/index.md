The Weekly Recommender is a weekly series that I plan to write for two purposes, giving myself a reason to revisit the content I encountered the past week, collect them in one place and make the highlights accessible to my readers. They don't necesarily have been published last week, I just found them during the past seven days. You can also checkout my profiles on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:florian.eckerstorfer) and [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/florianec).
