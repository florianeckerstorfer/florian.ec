description: Instead of keeping files in a complicated hierarchy of folders I store my files in a flat hierarchy and use search to find them.

About five years ago I declared bankruptcy on my file system. I was nearing the end of university, I was working nearly full-time and I for the past few years I was an adult with bills to pay, insurances and bank accounts.

In the previous years I had built a complicated hierarchy inside my Documents folder. The first level represented the major aspects of my life: University, Work, Projects and Private. University was divided into semesters and each semester into courses. Work consisted of clients and projects for each client as well as general files for each client. Projects contained sub-folders for each of my side projects. And finally Private was a complete mess. There were invoices, order confirmations, important documents about my insurance or bank accounts and lots of random files and photos.

When I was looking for a document I always had to look through multiple folders before finding the right file. Sometimes the file was not were I thought it should be and I would wonder if it was in the wrong folder or if the file was missing (eg, maybe I did forgot to archive my phone bill for April 2012). Since I was already giving my files descriptive names and Spotlight on Mac OS was already good enough, I would ignore the hierarchy and just search for them.

The other problem was that whenever I had new file, either a document I created or a file I received, I needed to decide were to put it. Each document has many vectors that could be used to archive it. Invoices can be grouped by year, by company name or first by year and then by company name. I can also put invoices that I can. If my phone company changed its name should I rename the folder or create a new one?

I was fatigued by too many decisions on where to put a file and for what? I did not use the hierarchy to access them.
