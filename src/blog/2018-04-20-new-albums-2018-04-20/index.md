After a break last week because I was graduating from university I have two new albums for you this week.

## Hippo Lite by DRINKS

The first one is Hippo Lite by DRINKS. DRINKS is a collaboration between Cate Le Bon and Tim Presley (White Fence) and Hippo Lite is their second album after Hermits on Holiday from 2015.

## The Recognitions by Exitmusic

When I read _Exitmusic_ my mind will always wander to [Exit Music (For a Film)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Na0siMtWOW9pJoWJ1Ponv). Exitmusic (the band), however, are making dream pop since 2003 and their new album The Recognitions is perfect for a nice spring evening.

I would recommend [Iowa](https://exitmusic.bandcamp.com/track/iowa) for a start, which you can stream from Bandcamp.
