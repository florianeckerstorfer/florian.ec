          <h2>Biography</h2>

          <p>
            I was born and raised in Linz, Austria and graduated from
            <em>HLW fÃ¼r Kommunikations- und Mediendesign</em>, which included an
            education in Econimics as well as in communication and media design.
            After school I moved to Vienna to study{' '}
            <em>Software & Information Engineering</em> at the Vienna University
            of Technology. In July 2011 I received my bachelors degree and
            started my Masters in
            <em>Software Engineering & Internet Computing</em>. In March 2012 I
            also began working on a supplement curriculum in <em>Innovation</em>,
            which I received in March 2014. I finished my Masters studies in
            January 2018 by writing my thesis on{' '}
            <em>
              Machine Learning Approach for Web Ranking Identification based on
              Visual Features
            </em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I was a child I made magazines with friends and sold them to
            family members. When the Internet became a thing I moved my creative
            endeavors into the digital space. I tought myself the required
            design and programming skills and started making websites about
            stuff I like. After some years of freelancing while in school I
            started my first serious job at 2beFOUND in Vienna to build web
            sites and applications. Nowadays I create applications that collect,
            analyze and move around large amounts of data. In April 2016 I
            joined the startup <a href="https://kiweno.com">Kiweno</a> in Vienna
            as a full time Frontend Developer. Since January 2017 I am working
            full time at <a href="https://www.swell.wtf">Swell</a> as Frontend
            &amp; Mobile App Developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            I never stopped creating websites and applications about stuff I am
            passionate about. For multiple years I ran a weblog called{' '}
            <a href="http://webadventures.at">Web Adventures</a> and I
            constantly do new, small <Link to="/projects/">projects</Link>.
