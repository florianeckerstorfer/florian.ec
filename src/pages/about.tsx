        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Linz, Austria and graduated from{' '}
          <em>HLW f√ºr Kommunikations- und Mediendesign</em>, which included an
          education in Econimics as well as in communication and media design.
          After school I moved to Vienna to study{' '}
          <em>Software & Information Engineering</em> at the Vienna University
          of Technology. In July 2011 I received my bachelors degree and started
          my Masters in <em>Software Engineering & Internet Computing</em>. In
          March 2012 I also began working on a supplement curriculum in{' '}
          <em>Innovation</em>, which I received in March 2014. I finsished my
          Masters studies in January 2018 by writing my thesis on{' '}
          <em>
            Machine Learning Approach for Web Ranking Identification based on
            Visual Features
          </em>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was a child I made magazines with friends and sold them to
          family members. When the Internet became a thing I moved my creative
          endeavors into the digital space. I tought myself the required design
          and programming skills and started making websites about stuff I like.
          After some years of freelancing while in school I started my first
          serious job at 2beFOUND in Vienna to build web sites and applications.
          Nowadays I create applications that collect, analyze and move around
          large amounts of data. In April 2016 I joined the startup{' '}
          <a href="https://kiweno.com">Kiweno</a> in Vienna as a full time
          Frontend Developer. From January 2017 to Mai 2018 I was working full
          time at <a href="https://www.swell.wtf">Swell</a> as Frontend &amp;
          Mobile App Developer. Since August 2018 I work as a Senior Frontend
          Developer at <a href="https://mysugr.com">mySugr</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I never stopped creating websites and applications about stuff I am
          passionate about. For multiple years I ran a weblog called{' '}
          <a href="http://webadventures.at">Web Adventures</a> and over the
          years I created a number of fun side-
          <Link to="/projects">projects</Link>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also have a <Link to="/cv">CV</Link>.
