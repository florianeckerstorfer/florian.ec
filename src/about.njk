  <h2>Biography</h2>

  <p>I was born and raised in Linz, Austria and graduated from <em>HLW f√ºr Kommunikations- und Mediendesign</em>, which included an education in Econimics as well as in communication and media design. After school I moved to Vienna to study <em>Software & Information Engineering</em> at the Vienna University of Technology. In July 2011 I received my bachelors degree and started my Masters in <em>Software Engineering & Internet Computing</em>. In March 2012 I also began working on a supplement curriculum in <em>Innovation</em>, which I received in March 2014. I finsished my Masters studies in January 2018 by writing my thesis on <em> Machine Learning Approach for Web Ranking Identification based on Visual Features</em>.</p>

  <p>When I was a child I made magazines with friends and sold them to family members. When the Internet became a thing I moved my creative endeavors into the digital space. I tought myself the required design and programming skills and started making websites about stuff I like. After some years of freelancing while in school I started my first serious job in 2008 at 2beFOUND in Vienna to build web sites and applications. In April 2016 I joined the startup <a href="https://kiweno.com">Kiweno</a> in Vienna as a full time Frontend Developer.

In August 2018 I joined <a href="https://mysugr.com">mySugr</a> as Senior Frontend Developer. Since January 2020 I am the Head of Web Development at mySugr.</p>

  <p>I never stopped creating websites and applications about stuff I am passionate about. For multiple years I ran a weblog called <a href="http://webadventures.at">Web Adventures</a> and over the years I created a number of fun side-<a href="/projects">projects</a>.</p>
