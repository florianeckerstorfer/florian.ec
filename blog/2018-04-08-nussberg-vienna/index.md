![Imagine walking on a street at the edge of Vienna, on the left side is the tiniest stream you can imagine. Grass is growing on the bank and flowers are blossoming. On the other side of the stream some kind of ivy is growing, between a few trees there is a fallen tree trunk, rotting on the ground. What is dead may never die](./01.jpg)
![Heiligenst√§dter Friedhof is cemetery at the edge of Vienna. When the rows of graves are ending the rolling hills are filled with vineyards. In this photo you are seeing the tower of a small chapel that is located near the entrance of the cemetery.](./02.jpg)

![This photo shows the edge of the park, where the city meets nature. It shows recycling bins for glass, and a tree; green grass and parked cars. This is art, because it makes you think about the beauty of parks clashing with the reality of life in the city.](./11.jpg)
