Two weeks ago I was hiking in Großarl, slept at Loosbühelalm and climbed Draugstein (2359m). Here are some pictures.

After we came back to Loosbühelalm it rained for a while and was foggy, but then the sky started clearing again.

We climbed Gründegg (2168m) and got some pretty light and shadow play.
