## Biography

I was born and raised in Linz, Austria and graduated from *HLW für Kommunikations- und Mediendesign*. After school I moved to Vienna and to study *Software & Information Engineering* at Vienna University of Technology. In July 2011 I received my bachelors degree and started my Masters in *Software Engineering & Internet Computing*. In March 2012 I also began working on a supplement curriculum in *Innovation*, which I received in March 2014.

When I was a child I made magazines with friends and sold them to our families. When the Internet became a thing I moved my creative endeavors into the digital space. I tought myself the required design and programming skills and started making websites about stuff I like. After some years of freelancing while in school I started my first serious job at 2beFOUND in Vienna to build web sites and applications. Nowadays I create applications that collect, analyze and move around large amounts of data.

I never stopped creating websites and applications about stuff I am passionate about. For multiple years I ran a weblog called [Web Adventures](http://webadventures.at) and I constantly do new, small [projects](/projects/).
