Back in June I talked about [Streams in Gulp.js](/articles/gulp-js-streams/) at the Vienna.js meetup and Roland Sch√ºtz filmed and edited the video and it's now available on YouTube: [Streams in Gulp.js (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRe7_xsQBUQ)

There are things I could have done better, especially in the question and answer part, but I am actually pretty proud of it.
