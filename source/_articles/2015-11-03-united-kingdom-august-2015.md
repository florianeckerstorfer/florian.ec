For the last couple days the weather in Vienna was cold, wet, and windy. This reminded me of my trip to Scotland in the summer and the fact that I still have not posted any pictures here. Many of these I have already put on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/florian_/) or [Tumblr](http://42reasons.com), but I wanted to all have them here on my on server.

Together with my friend Karin we bought Interrail tickets and on the first day we started from Linz to Cologne.

On the second day we took a train to Rotterdam and then a ferry to Harwich in England and spent a night in London.

We had some problems finding a place to sleep, so we were quite happy when we found a hostel in Inverness for three nights.

On the first day we took a a trip to Dunrobin Castle, which is a pretty nice castle at the east cost of Scotland.

One of the places we wanted to visit was the Isle of Skye, because there is absolutely no reliable public transport going to the Isle we had to book a bus tour.
