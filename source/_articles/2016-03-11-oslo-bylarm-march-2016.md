{% block summary %}
Oslo has been on my list of cities I wanted to visit for some time now and when I saw the lineup of [By:Larm festival](http://bylarm.no) I knew that I needed to go to Oslo in March. Once again my friend Karin decided to join me and here we are, after five days in the capital of Norway in which we saw amazing bands, drank the most expensive beers of our lives, used the subway to get to Oslos skiing area and had a really great time.

On the second day snow from the previous night was still covered the ground of Oslo and we walked around the city. Along Karl johann gate through Slottsparken and around the new waterfront area. We also visited the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, drank coffee and ate Kanelbulle. On the way back to our aparment we walked through the old fortress, Akershus festning.

The next day we took the subway (T-banen) to Holmenkolmmen, visited the Ski Museum and took the elevator to the top of the ski jump tower (Holmenkollbakken). The biathlon world championship was while we were there, so there was a lot of action going on. On our way home we stopped at Fram musueum to learn about the history of polar expeditions and visit the boats that took the Norwegians to the poles.
