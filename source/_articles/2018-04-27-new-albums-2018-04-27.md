You know the drill by now: another Friday, another list of great new albums.

## Lavender by Half Waif

After the brilliant *Form/a* EP from last year Half Waif have released their second album Lavender today. This is the finest synth pop.

## In the Rainbow Rain by Okkervil River

This is Okkervil River ninth official full length album since 2002. That's a lot of output and I still like their version of folk rock.
