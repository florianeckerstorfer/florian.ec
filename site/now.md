In the last couple of months I'm thinking a lot about owning music again. Instead of streaming everything from Apple Music, I buy albums I like, mostly from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com). Currently I listen to music most often in [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/) on Mac and iOS, however, while the manual synching of files is ok, having no way to synchronize playlists and likes is very annoying.

Yesterday I finished reading _The Innovator's Dilemma_ by Clayton M. Christensen and next up are _The Culture Map_ by Erin Mayer and Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay by Elena Ferrante.

Marina and I are currently watching Friends, I only saw a couple of episodes here and there over the years and it's my first time watching through all of them.

This year I admitted to myself that I will buy and play both of them anyway and I bought both Pok√©mon Brilliant Diamond and Shiny Pearl on launch day. In Brilliant Diamond I'm already in the post game, while I just made it to badge number 5 in Shiny Pearl.
