In the last couple of months I'm thinking a lot about owning music again. Instead of streaming everything from Apple Music, I buy albums I like, mostly from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com). I'm still experimenting with apps to listen to my growing collection, my favourites are currently [Plexamp](https://plexamp.com) and [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/).

Currently reading _My Brilliant Friend_ by Elena Ferrante and _The ART of Avoiding a Train Wreck_ by Em Campbell-Pretty & Adrienne L. Wilson for work.

Marina and I binging through eleven seasons of _Bob's Burger_. We're also watching _Ted Lasso_ and _What If?_.

This is a [_now_](https://nownownow.com/about) page.
