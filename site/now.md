In the last couple of months I'm thinking a lot about owning music again. Instead of streaming everything from Apple Music, I buy albums I like, mostly from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com). I'm still experimenting with apps to listen to my growing collection, my favourites are currently [Plexamp](https://plexamp.com) and [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/).

Yesterday I finished reading _The Innovator's Dilemma_ by Clayton M. Christensen and next up are _The Culture Map_ by Erin Mayer and Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay by Elena Ferrante.

Marina and I are currently watching Friends, I only saw a couple of episodes here and there over the years and it's my first time watching through all of them.
