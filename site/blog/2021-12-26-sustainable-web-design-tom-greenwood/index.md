description: Review of Sustainable Web Design by Tom Greenwood.
---

In classic A Book Apart fashion [_Sustainable Web Design_](https://abookapart.com/products/sustainable-web-design) by Tom Greenwood provides us with a concise introduction on creating websites that consume less energy, produce less carbon emissions and have the least impact on our planet.

After a quick introduction why we should care about creating sustainable websites, we learn how to measure the impact of websites and how we can design and develop more sustainable. Greenwood also explains some of the considerations to look at when choosing a green web hoster, for example, the effect of scale on the carbon emissions of data centres and the different ways that data centres can become green. Chapter 6 is the least relevant for me, since I don't need to sell my work to clients. In summary, everything that makes a website sustainable also makes the website better: higher performance, better accessibility, faster loading times, etc.

The book finishes with a chapter on the challenges the climate crisis brings for the internet: data centres that are built in areas likely to be flooded, or increased need to cool servers when temperatures rise.

While I think about my impact on the environment on a daily basis, I never really thought about the impact my websites and code have before. In the _Selling Sustainable Web Design_ chapter Greenwood explains that many of the things that make a website more sustainable are just good web design, Sustainable Web Design has opened my eyes to include environmental impact in my design and development decisions.

PS: In the past I would have included a picture of the cover in this blog post. After you have read this book you know why I didn't this time.
