Once in a while I come across a song that moves me in a way that I cannot explain. [I've Got You by Camp Cope](https://campcope.bandcamp.com/track/ive-got-you-2) is one of these songs. Every time I listen to it, the songs story unfolds in my mind like a movie and the emotions feel so real.

> So they tried radiation and chemicals too<br>
> And now you're standing on the last line<br>
> And so am I, I've got you<br>
> You've got me too<br>
> Hold on, I've got you
