description: The list of all 43 books that I read in 2021.
---

In 2021 I read 43 books, quite a lot of the books this year were related to my job and looking at the stack of books on my desk that I plan to read next this trend is likely to continue. I also started to read the Neapolitian Saga by Elena Ferrante and the next two books about the releationship of Elena and Lila are already waiting for me.

The most remarkable book I have read this year was **Disappearing Earth** by Julia Phillips. The story of two abducted girls is told over twelve months through the lense of twelve different woman that are connected to the two girls through different levels of separation. Huge recommendation.
