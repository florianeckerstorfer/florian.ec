description: Use Shortcuts on iOS to automatically enable Do Not Disturb before playing Daily Calm.
---

Don't worry if you felt icky clicking on a blog post called _Automating Meditation_, I felt icky writing it. I don't need to increase the efficiency or throughput of my meditation practice, but I can also use automation to reduce the chance of human error. Before I sit down with [Calm](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calm-sleep-meditation/id571800810) I always want enable Do Not Disturb mode. Annoyingly I forgot this often enough and my practice is disturbed by notifications, that I was looking into Shortcuts if I can make the computer help me.

I ended up with a simple Shortcut that enables _Do Not Disturb_ for 12 minutes, sets the playback destination to my AirPods and then starts a Daily Calm meditation. To not stick with old behaviours I removed the Calm app from home screen and instead replaced it with the Shortcut. I have also created another Shortcut that starts a sleep story.

Here are two four steps in my Shortcut:
