Last Saturday I finished reading [Creativity, Inc.](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0593070100/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0593070100&linkCode=as2&tag=fecom-21) by Ed Catmull, the president of Pixar Animation and Disney Animation. He writes about how to build and run a creative company and how Pixar's management fosters creativity and innovation.

I really enjoyed reading the book and I think most of the principles do not only apply to movie companies but to all companies that employ creative people. That includes software companies. It also made me want to watch Pixar movies. Last weekend I already saw Toy Story 3 and Brave. Seven more movies to go.
