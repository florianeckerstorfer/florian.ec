If there is an indie rock band that has the same name as an Ibiza DJ, they are the same band for *"the algorithm"*. Yes, computers are very stupid. However, occassionally, and I want to stress the word occassionally, this namespace pollution leads to a happy accident.

I use an app called [MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750) to inform me about new releases of bands that I like. Back in March it informed me that Sloppy Jane has released a new album. They are a New York-based punk rock orchestra and I've listened to their first album [Willow](https://sloppyjanemusic.bandcamp.com/album/willow-2) a couple of times. A couple of days after adding *Kissing in the Rain* to my library, I listened to it and immediately liked it. But something was wrong. It did not sound like an album from a New York-based punk rock orchestra, that are famous for their [*intense* live shows](https://www.gazettemusicale.com/live/2017/9/8/sloppy-jane) (ðŸ‘ˆ NSFW). I checked Sloppy Jane's social media, Bandcamp, website; no mention of a new album.

When searching for `sloppy jane` I could only find information about the punk rock band and their NSWF live shows, but the album was credited to *Sloppy Jane & Margot Nijhuis*, which lead me to a blog post from 2011 where Margot Nijhuis was interviewed. She works for a large health insurance company and in her spare time writes books and makes pretty good music.

We reached the point of the article where I recommend you to listen to Kissing in the Rain by Sloppy Jane & Margot Nijhuis on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/at/album/kissing-in-the-rain/1561707970?l=en) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3bgifxLEyCHIeOZz2T05A9).

If you're wondering why I write this eigth months after it was released, on Friday Sloppy Jane (the New York-based punk rock orchestra) released their second album, [Madison](https://sloppyjanemusic.bandcamp.com/album/madison). [It was recorded in a cave](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/arts/music/sloppy-jane-madison-cave.html).
